## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: CrossChain ID Verifier
- **Category**: identity

### Description
Our vApp solves the challenge of managing fragmented identities across multiple blockchains. By leveraging Soundness Layer (SL) as a coordination layer, we enable users to maintain a unified cross-chain identity state. This allows seamless verification of credentials in a privacy-preserving manner, eliminating the need to repeatedly prove identity on different networks.

### SL Integration
- **Cross-chain Coordination:** SL smart contracts manage and update user identity data across all supported chains, enabling seamless interoperability.
- **Privacy Preservation:** Through SL’s support for zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, credential verification is performed without revealing sensitive user data.
- **Credential Verification:** SL provides a standardized interface for dApps to request and verify credentials, making integration simple and secure.
- **Access Control:** SL enables fine-grained permissioning, allowing users to control which credentials are shared and with whom.


## Technical
- True cross-chain identity coordination
- Privacy preservation through cryptography
- Reduced integration effort for third-party dApps
- Scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized identity

### Architecture
This approach streamlines decentralized identity management, protects user data, and enables scalable, secure interactions in the Web3 ecosystem.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js + GraphQL
- **Blockchain**: SL + Ethereum + Polygon
- **Storage**: IPFS + PostgreSQL

### Features
- Aggregates identity data and credentials from diverse chains, providing a single profile for users.
- Uses SL’s privacy-preserving mechanisms to verify credentials without exposing sensitive information.
- Automates credential verification for dApps across ecosystems, reducing onboarding friction.
- Empowers users with granular control over which credentials are shared and when.

## Timeline

### PoC (3 weeks)
- [x] SL identity contract
- [x] Basic frontend
- [ ] Cross-chain verification

### MVP (6 weeks)
- [ ] Full verification system
- [ ] API for developers
- [ ] Mobile support

## Innovation
This approach solves the problem of fragmented identities and insecure verification processes in Web3. Users now have a unified, privacy-preserving identity that works across chains, setting a new standard for secure and scalable decentralized identity management.
